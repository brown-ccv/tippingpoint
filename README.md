# Tipping Point Analysis

This repository contains the analysis for tipping point analysis of survey data.

## Package dependencies

The preprocessing, descriptive statistics, and logistic regression were done in Julia (01,02,03). The decisiontree and randomforest classifiers were done in Python due to the power of scikitlearn (python_analysis). Will add package dependencies for each section later.
